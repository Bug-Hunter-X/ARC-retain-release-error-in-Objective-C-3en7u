This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to memory management in Objective-C using ARC.  The `bug.m` file contains code that incorrectly manages object lifetimes, leading to unpredictable behavior. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.m`, corrects the memory management issues to ensure the correct behavior.  Understanding ARC nuances and proper implementation of retain/release methods are critical for avoiding these types of errors.
