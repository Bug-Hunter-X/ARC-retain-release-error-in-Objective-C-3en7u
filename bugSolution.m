The solution involves carefully reviewing and correcting the `retain`, `release`, and `dealloc` methods. Ensure that `retain` increments the retain count correctly, `release` decrements it, and `dealloc` properly releases all owned objects and calls `[super dealloc]`.  Avoid manual memory management as much as possible and leverage ARC's automatic mechanisms to prevent these kinds of errors.

```objectivec
// bugSolution.m
@implementation MyClass
- (id)retain {
    return [super retain];
}
- (oneway void)release {
    [super release];
}
- (void)dealloc {
    [myObject release]; // Release owned objects
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```
