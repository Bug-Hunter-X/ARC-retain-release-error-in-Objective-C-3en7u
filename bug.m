In Objective-C, a rare but perplexing issue can arise from the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and custom retain/release methods.  If you override `retain`, `release`, or `dealloc` incorrectly, especially when dealing with complex object relationships or third-party libraries, you might encounter unexpected crashes or memory leaks that are difficult to debug.  For example, not properly balancing retain and release calls, or forgetting to call `[super dealloc]` in `dealloc`, can lead to double-releases or premature deallocations, causing corruption.
